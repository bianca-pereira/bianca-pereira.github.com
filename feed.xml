        <title>Days 5 and 6: Creating the product and no book cover yet. (Gumroad 14 Day Product Challenge)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These last two days I have focused on creating the first draft of the e-book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindset strategies to bring ideas from mind to paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main goal is to have the content of the product ready, have some early feedback on it and then I decide on format and book cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nothing like a badly written first draft. 2 chapters drafted, 8 more to go :)&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WritingCommunity?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#WritingCommunity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/writing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcWriMo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#AcWriMo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gUuTLfFkbV&quot;&gt;https://t.co/gUuTLfFkbV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/X881IMAbex&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/X881IMAbex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1322541911350120448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have focused on unpacking the problem given in the title of the book (&lt;em&gt;“I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!”&lt;/em&gt;), explaining three possible causes for that feeling. Then I come into chapter 2 listing good well-intended advice that just does not work :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never thought about “the voice” for the book, I just faced that when starting drafting. It started “too academic and distant”, when I wanted something more “personal” since the book is a personal take on a problem I faced multiple times and have helped other people with the same issues. When writing a blog post I tend to give me own personal perspective, when writing an academic article I let the content take precedence. For the book I really was not sure how I wanted to write. I ended up writing more like “my advice for you”, which is a voice I don’t really like. I prefer more “this is my experience and I am sharing it with you”. So, despite having drafted two chapters, I may still change the tone all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I am also engaging with my target audience, not only for “sales purposes” but to keep engaging on the discussions, learning from them and also adding value where I can. In addition I have also planned some talks on the content of the book, what may help me promote it and get feedback. Let’s see how it goes :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 4: Taking easy and creating the timeline. (Gumroad 14 Day Product Challenge)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that I prefer to write first thing in the morning rather than at the end of the day (the time I have assigned to this project) I have changed my timelines and went easy on myself today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today I had just created the timeline for the development of the product, with expected completion date to Friday 06th November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my MVP, I am thinking it as simple as a PDF created via Google Docs (that also exports as ePUB, by the way), some basic illustrations using diagrams.net and a cover with free stock images and free fonts. When the MVP is done then perhaps I can spend some time studying how to use more professional applications for formatting the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile there is an opportunity to participate in a tweetchat next Monday on the topic of my book. Very exciting! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/VirtualNotViral?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#VirtualNotViral&lt;/a&gt; chats about a month of and for academic writing. What does it mean for you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/acj0tXofEx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/acj0tXofEx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; @PhD-virtualnotviral (@virtualnotviral) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/virtualnotviral/status/1321786183710552064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward for the next steps in the 14 Day Product challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 3: Validating the idea and Product Outline. (Gumroad 14 Day Product Challenge)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I have narrowed down the topic of my product (Communication and Engagement) with the help of my prospective audience. I created a poll on Twitter listing three common communication problems faced by researchers, in particular early career ones, and asked what they find the worst one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PhD&lt;/a&gt; student, which of these you see as your worst challenge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!&lt;br /&gt;2. I just gave a presentation , but no one seems to have understood it.&lt;br /&gt;3. No one is paying attention to my presentation.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdchat?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#phdchat&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdlife?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#phdlife&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicChatter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#AcademicChatter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1321185998844383232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having received 60 votes, the result was: “I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three learnings here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The results are exactly as I expected, what may mean I know a little bit about this specific audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even after I close the poll people still interact with the Tweet, which means I could have gathered more answers may I have let it run longer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I really need to respect the “engagement time” of my audience. I know when this specific audience is around Twitter since they are mostly in Europe and Australia. If I tweet at USA times (following the timeline of the challenge) I get almost no engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, having chosen the problem I will tackle, it is time to outline the product I want to offer. For now I have gone through the route of creating a single ebook, but I do like the idea of having an e-book with a hands-on supplement, or even having a video related to the content (following on the footsteps of &lt;a href=&quot;https://philipkiely.com/notes/14_day_product.html&quot;&gt;Philip Kiely&lt;/a&gt;). I am just not sure I can deliver all these within the 14 days of the challenge so I will keep it ‘small’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The product (working description):&lt;/strong&gt; Aiming at solving common writing problems faced by PhD students and early career researchers, “I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!” Mindset strategies to bring ideas from mind to paper is an e-book that addresses writer’s block and the feeling of being overwhelmed with too many ideas. By applying a mindset-driven framework to writing, coupled with practical strategies, this e-book brings a methodology that leads the reader from concept expression to a first draft without feeling overwhelmed. Use the 5 writing mindsets methodology today and start writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Title:&lt;/strong&gt; “I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!” Mindset strategies to bring ideas from mind to paper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unpacking the problem
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I know what I want to say&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I just can’t write it&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Common (good and well-intentioned) advice and why it does not work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 5 writing mindsets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create: Putting your thoughts into the paper
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to activate the right mindset?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strategies and Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect: Clarifying the connections between thoughts
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to activate the right mindset?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strategies and Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Structure: Building a coherent argument
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to activate the right mindset?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strategies and Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit: Converting your raw thoughts into paragraphs
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to activate the right mindset?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strategies and Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review: Judging the quality of your work
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to activate the right mindset?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strategies and Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not stop in the first draft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready to write?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Day 2: Topic chosen, the feedback only comes tomorrow though. (Gumroad 14 Day Product Challenge)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have finally narrowed down to a single topic based on the feedback on multiple people closer to me. I asked them: “What would you like to learn from me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most answers were on the topic of &lt;strong&gt;Communication and Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;. The main reason is that I have been studying, experimenting and teaching about presentation skills and writing strategies for researchers in the last 5 years. It also called my attention because I have already some content structured for talks and workshops I gave in the past, so it would be mostly about converting it into an e-book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I decided to break the topic into 3 problems that researchers (my audience) usually face and added as a poll on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PhD&lt;/a&gt; student, which of these you see as your worst challenge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!&lt;br /&gt;2. I just gave a presentation , but no one seems to have understood it.&lt;br /&gt;3. No one is paying attention to my presentation.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdchat?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#phdchat&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdlife?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#phdlife&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicChatter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#AcademicChatter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1321185998844383232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers started coming back but I know this is a very bad time to get feedback from this particular audience. I have scheduled another Twitter for tomorrow with what I know is a more suitable time. Let’s see what happens by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the three options available, I have a good feeling that people will be mostly interested in problem 1, which I already have an idea for one product and one supplement for it. In any case, let’s see how it goes tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 1: Public Brainstorm (Gumroad 14 Day Product Challenge)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first day of the Gumroad 14 Day Product challenge was all about identifying what is the product we want to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify what I will be creating I have applied two strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public brainstorming.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Requests for Feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-brainstorming&quot;&gt;Public Brainstorming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Day 1 I decided to go for a public brainstorm of ideas on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I have joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/14DayProduct?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#14DayProduct&lt;/a&gt; challenge at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gumroad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gumroad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal is to create a product within 14 days based only on personal experience on the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings the question: What do I know enough to be able to teach?  Let me go through some ideas 1/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HWHA627f8h&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HWHA627f8h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1320790088377389058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have knowledge in different areas I find it really hard to decide on what I want to focus first (that has always being my problem). So I decided to brainstorm something in all areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some of the learnings I got in participating in &lt;strong&gt;academia-industry project collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I could build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/14DayProduct?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#14DayProduct&lt;/a&gt; based on my experience in working with academia-industry collaborations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.. getting from idea to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/industry?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#industry&lt;/a&gt;-ready prototype&lt;br /&gt;.. how to manage industry-academia &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/research?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#research&lt;/a&gt;  projects&lt;br /&gt;.. how to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/KnowledgeTransfer?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#KnowledgeTransfer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECRchat?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ECRchat&lt;/a&gt;  2/&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1320790090248032258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;experience with quitting a PhD&lt;/strong&gt; (for not knowing a lot of stuff and having a hard time) to &lt;strong&gt;starting again&lt;/strong&gt; a part-time PhD &lt;strong&gt;3 years later&lt;/strong&gt; (now with WAY more knowledge):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or perhaps I could build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/14DayProduct?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#14DayProduct&lt;/a&gt; based on  my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PhD&lt;/a&gt; experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.. strategies to deal with writer&amp;#39;s block&lt;br /&gt;.. project and time management tips for PhD students&lt;br /&gt;.. the basics of research paper writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/acwri?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#acwri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.. how to fail your PhD (quitting and back)&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdchat?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#phdchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/phdforum?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#phdforum&lt;/a&gt; 3/&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1320790091875442689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience in starting a &lt;strong&gt;Equality, Diversity and Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt; committee in a highly hierarchical institution where I was at the bottom of the hierarchy. Also, how to add these values into software-related projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Perhaps I could tap on my knowledge on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Equality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Equality&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Diversity?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Diversity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/inclusion?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#inclusion&lt;/a&gt;  for  the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/14DayProduct?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#14DayProduct&lt;/a&gt;  challenge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.. influence without power: how to start an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EDI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EDI&lt;/a&gt; initiative?&lt;br /&gt;.. creating and managing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CitizenScience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CitizenScience&lt;/a&gt; project based on EDI values&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/scicomm?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#scicomm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECRchat?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ECRchat&lt;/a&gt; 4/&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bianca Pereira (@bianca_oli_per) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1320790093536382976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some vague ideas around my research &lt;strong&gt;topic of expertise&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requests-for-feedback&quot;&gt;Requests for Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had a public brainstorm, without real intention on getting feedback from that. I contacted a group of friends with the following request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi =) I am participating in the #14DayProduct challenge where we need to create a product (an e-book, an experience sharing course, a how-to or something like that) in 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am reaching out to my friends for some help: If I could teach you anything that I know. What would you like to learn about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what I will learn from them :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gumroad 14 Day Product Challenge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to create an info product for a long time already, but have been postponing the idea for a number of years. This time I decided to move this idea forward by joining the Gumroad challenge to create an info product in 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what is Gumroad!? &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/&quot;&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; is a platform that supports creators in launching and selling their products. From their own website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creators deserve to get paid for their work. We make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/l/BLwER&quot;&gt;14 Day Product Challenge&lt;/a&gt; consists of choosing an audience and building a small info product (e.g. a book, a video, a course, a template, a piece of code) that adds value to that audience. The participants in the challenge are expected to work a little bit everyday on their projects and share their journey with other participants in the challenge. Meanwhile, the organisers send a daily email with tips on how to move the product forward step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/6282492303727/asset_previews/5fc9b753ab5be0174bd579ef51f18d60/retina/image2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;25%&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gumroad &quot;14 Day Product Guide&quot; to be released at the end of the challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the opportunity that I am off work next week, I will have a bit of time to dedicate to this idea. Although I do not expect to be launching any product by the end of 14 days (given all my other commitments), I still expect to have had as much progress as I can in this timeline and have at least a draft product ready to share with some “early enthusiasts” :) Let’s see what I can do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check my progress in the following posts:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/Day-2-Gumroad-14-Day-Product-Challenge-2020-10-27/&quot;&gt;Day 2: Topic chosen, the feedback only comes tomorrow though&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Multimodality and the change in meaning.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans do not make meaning just by using their eyes, just by using their ears, or just by tactile sensations. Instead, humans make meaning by aggregating the input we receive from all our sensors. In this blog post I will talk about multimodality and meaning making by sharing my experience in attending the Multimodal Tutor workshop at the JTELSS2019. To check my reflections on other workshops in this Summer School, check my &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/Reflections_on_jTEL_Summer_School_2019_A_Blog_Series-2019-06-16/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Multimodal Tutor by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dimstudi0?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@dimstudi0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SuperHeroBooth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SuperHeroBooth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/jtelss19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#jtelss19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A well-developed approach and tools, engaging presentation, impressive demonstrations and very serious challenges addressed!&lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; full room of participants, as expected!&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bJXCe1XUhg&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bJXCe1XUhg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Lbkl3U6oXh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Lbkl3U6oXh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; JTELSS (@jtelss) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jtelss/status/1136564897393840128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 6, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Computer Science, and Technology-Enhanced Learning, the term modality refers to &lt;em&gt;“a particular form of sensory perception”&lt;/em&gt; (according to a particularly good definition given by Google dictionary). For instance, image is a modality, audio is another modality, etc. Therefore, when talking about multimodality, we are talking about aggregating multiple types of sensorial information. In this workshop, we were given a few good examples on how data in one modality can completely change the interpretation generated by data from another modality, and we learned what are the work of the workshop organisers in promoting multimodality for learning analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop was organised using a lecture-style presentation with the introduction of catchy examples and interesting demos. The first presenter was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SuperHeroBooth&quot;&gt;Jan Schneider &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the Open University in Netherlands, showing through multiple examples how the addition of a modality can change the interpretation given to a piece of data so far. In one of these examples he played an audio file and asked us which instrument was been played. By the sound of it, most people suggested it was a violin, however, when pairing the audio with a video of a person playing the instrument we could see that it was, in fact, a saw!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Kmft674XPC0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you had your eyes closed, would you say it is not a violin?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another example, Jan showed how a video sequence from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean could receive completely different interpretations depending on the audio that goes with it. So, having motivated us on how adding a new modality can change our interpretation of data, Jan passed the stage to Daniele di Mitri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/rn9V0cN4NWs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example on how the audio modality can change the meaning of the video modality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dimstudi0&quot;&gt;Daniele di Mitri &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also from the Open University in Netherlands, presented the potential of multimodality for the development of intelligent tutoring systems. He started by introducing how the concept of multimodality applies to computers: whereas humans have a series of natural sensors (e.g. ear, eye, mouth, skin) and use them to interpret the world around them, computers also deal with data coming from a multitude of sensors (e.g. camera, audio record, GPS, light sensors) and can use them to capture semantic information (i.e. meaning) about a given context. When computers are able to observe, through their sensors, how humans behave while learning a given task (e.g. the type of mistakes humans are making) and make sense of what they perceive, then computers will become more equipped at supporting humans on how to learn effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make this vision a reality, Daniele argues that, in learning analytics, it is not enough to provide computers with sensorial data. Instead, computers also need to reason about elements that are not embedded in the signals themselves, such as beliefs, emotions, cognition, or motivation. In Machine Learning terms, we need to provide computers with annotated training data, i.e. an association between a set of sensorial data and interpretations on what this data means in terms of metacognition, etc. By having such training data, one could train a machine learning model to predict what is being demonstrated by the behaviour of a learner. One challenge in the training of machine learning algorithms based on multimodal data is that there is not enough multimodal data annotated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniele's slide on how sensorial data needs to be paired with interpretation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support the generation of annotation of multimodal data, Daniele presents his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimstudio/visual-inspection-tool&quot;&gt;Visual Inspection Tool &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-git_hub&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This tool was developed to allow humans to synchronise data from multiple modalities and perform manual annotations (i.e. provide interpretations for the data) based on this aggregated data. One example given during the workshop was the use of this tool to annotate data about students learning how to perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a life saving procedure). Current CPR training involves the use of dolls containing multiple sensors so, when the student performs CPR in the doll, a series of data points are collected and used to provide feedback to the learner. However, Daniele points that such solution is limited since it does not capture certain body postures the student needs to have while performing CPR (e.g. arms locked rather than arms relaxed). By synchronising a video with the sensor data coming from the doll, one can verify if such body postures are applied or not, and even identify to which movement performed during CPR each sensor data coming from the doll refers to. Such tool provides as a result multimodal data annotated by humans and ready to use within machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniele's slide presenting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dimstudio/visual-inspection-tool&quot;&gt;Visual Inspection Tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the workshop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bibeglimbu&quot;&gt;Bibeg Limbu &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also from Open University in Netherlands, presented additional applications for multimodal data in learning environments: first an application that aims at detecting if a learner has achieved the state of flow while performing a given learning activity, and another application to support students in learning calligraphy. He then followed with a discussion on which modalities should be used to provide feedback to a learner: should we use one of the modalities the learner is currently engaged with? Or should we provide feedback using a completely different modality? For instance, if someone is learning calligraphy through an app then their vision and motor modalities are in use during the task, should the feedback be visual (in use in the task) or auditory (not currently in use within the task)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=13cwG_7A7hDnWbrTOZ77MXT9DZxZVulQq&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniele's slide presenting the Learning Pulse tool &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop was interesting to me for two reasons: first I got to learn a bit about multimodality and it got me thinking if and how I could apply it to my work; and second I got some interesting insights for my PhD by observing how Daniele has translated his PhD studies into multiple publications. Regarding the second item, I will save my comments to when I start my series of posts on my PhD practice. The most I would say now is that I got some ideas on how I could publish my Conceptual Model and I increased my confidence to publish a Literature Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the use of multimodality in my work, I do not see immediate application but it got me thinking: How can text be used in the context of multimodality? An obvious answer that came to mind was: in the detection of irony. Irony is something really hard to detect if one is using only text. My understanding is that we, as humans, detect irony mostly by observing discrepancies between the content of a message and changes in the speaker’s voice (e.g. speaking more slowly or with a different pitch in the voice) or facial expressions (e.g. roll the eyes). The problem with text is that it contains only the message, but not the ways in which irony is transmitted. In order to transmit irony in text, one needs to make more or less clear, by explaining the context, that a piece of text is ironic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=1_8Yp_ptc-IvWfTZnd9wj_aatV39VERvB&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is hard to detect irony in text...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, apart from detection of irony, I am not sure how else text could enter in the multimodality story. Any ideas? Feel free to discuss at the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rites of Passage: A transition between levels of reality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to share my experience attending the workshop on Rites of Passage: Creating impactful Scenarios for the Transition in Between Realities in Mixed-Reality. This is one more post in my reflections about the &lt;a href=&quot;(/posts/Reflections_on_jTEL_Summer_School_2019_A_Blog_Series-2019-06-16/)&quot;&gt;15th EATEL Summer School on Technology Enhanced Learning (JTELSS)&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose that, from all workshops, this was the most impactful for me and I explain you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MixedReality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#MixedReality&lt;/a&gt; workshop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CGNfil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@CGNfil&lt;/a&gt; and Jonas Zimmer presting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/portapraetoria?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#portapraetoria&lt;/a&gt; project visualizing ancient &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/cologne?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#cologne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JTELSS19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JTELSS19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CologneGameLab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@CologneGameLab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JMxcxr1ep7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JMxcxr1ep7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Roland Klemke (@rklemke) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rklemke/status/1135885405675577344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When organising my presentations, I don’t like to think that I will &lt;em&gt;“give a talk”&lt;/em&gt;. Saying that sounds as if I will be talking whatever I want to say, whereas people in the ‘audience’ need to be there just listening and waiting me to finish and leave (sounds familiar!?). Instead, I prefer to think that I will &lt;em&gt;“create an experience”&lt;/em&gt;. By creating an experience, now we have participants rather than an audience. People will feel, think, imagine, remember, talk or do something. This workshop gave me some hints on how to help people to smoothly change from their current reality (in this case their everyday life with the work they were just doing and/or still thinking about) into an alternative reality (i.e. a ‘world’ of ideas we will co-create during our time together).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop started in a very odd way. The organisers asked to scan our iris in order to register us for the workshop. It felt weird because I could see that it was so dark at the room that the phone camera could barely capture my eyes, even less detect my iris or anything else in that picture. Later I went to learn what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are you scanning my iris?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having our eyes scanned, the workshop started with an extremely interesting presentation topic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CGNfil&quot;&gt;Katharina Tillmans &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from Cologne Game Lab, started by introducing the Reality-Virtuality continuum. She explained that each of our experiences fall somewhere between Absolute Reality and Virtual Reality in this continuum. According to her, we never really get to experience Absolute Virtuality because, well.. we exist in the real world.. right? (Unless you believe in The Matrix, but that is another discussion). Therefore, each of our experiences using technology is more or less virtual. The problem, she claims, is that our current technological experiences create gaps in what should be a continuum space. For instance, when we use our phones to scan a QR code, at the first point in time we are in the reality and at a second point in time, BOOM, we are already within the virtual world navigatin some website or acessing a given app. Katharina points that the lack of a smooth transition between levels of reality is what creates a gap. The work of the workshop organisers is to improve people’s experiences by creating smooth transitions between levels of reality-virtuality and, consequently, removing this transition gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We never really get to experience Absolute Virtuality. Slides from Katharina Tillmans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fill the gaps in the reality-virtuality continuum, Katharina presented the idea of “Rites of Passage”. She explains that human life has a few common rites of passage (e.g. birth, marriage, childbirth and death) and that in each of these rites we pass through three stages: Separation, Liminality, and Incorporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage is the “Separation”, when one gets separated from their old self. She gives marriage as an example, where, depending on the culture, the groom and bride have bachelor and bachelorette parties with their friends in order to celebrate the end of their time as unmarried individuals. They are basically saying goodbye to their old selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage is the “Liminality”. It is the moment of transition into the new identity; it is the moment when one chooses to make the transition. In the marriage example, it happens when someone has the wedding ceremony and shares the vows or signs the marriage contract. At this moment, the individual takes the definitive decision into transitioning to the new self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and last stage is the “Incorporation”, where individuals start to get into the new role they chose. For instance, it is when the two newly weds start to accept and embed in their lives the idea of being a married couple. As I understand, at this stage the individual goes back to the world but with a different perspective on it and a new identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katharina claims that these three stages can be used to bring users from the absolute reality smoothly into the virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stages of a Rite of Passage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next presenter was Jonas Zimmer. He presents the Porta Praetoria project where the concept of Rites of Passage is used to teach children, through a game on their phones, about the life of the romans who lived in Cologne, Germany centuries ago. In this project, children start the Separation stage by inviting their friends to make a group of 3 explorers, downloading the app and deciding what will be the role of each player (navigator, excavator, or puzzle maker). Then, still in the Separation stage, the navigator guides the group to a given physical spot in the real world. At that spot, through the use of augmented reality technology, the group can see through the navigator’s camera that there is a portal at a specific point in the space. At this moment the “Liminality” is activated. Should the children cross the portal and move further in the virtuality continuum, or stay where they are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The navigator is the one who can see the portal and needs to physically go to the place and cross it. The other two members of the team can only pass through the portal if the navigator invites them in. Having chosen to pass the “Liminality”, i.e. having crossed the portal, the children now can see the city through augmented reality as it was at roman times in that specific location. Then, within this virtual world, they are in the “Incorporation” stage, where they are now explorers of the history of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we do not bring the kids so far just to abandon them in the virtual world. Instead, the way back is also smooth. Do you remember we still have an excavator and a puzzle maker in this story? After having observed how romans lived, the kids need to choose to cross the portal back to the reality in order to discover the artefacts the romans left behind. The excavator needs to use the app to find buried pieces of artefacts (e.g. vases, plates, cups), whereas the puzzle maker needs to assemble these pieces in their original form, i.e. rebuild the artefacts. The journey of our team guides them through the city and finishes at the local museum, where our explorers are brought back to reality by observing the real artefact they just built in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video demo of Porta Praetoria project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean… I love this story!! But it did not stop there. After the presentation, we were all divided into groups to design an experience that takes advantage of the concepts we just learned about. The challenge was: “How can we create an experience that support people living in Bari to save water?”. Our group came up with the idea of starting by showing how would be the world if we did not have enough water. As this post is getting too long, I will try to summarise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People would be invited to enter a house and try to wash their hands. By turning the tap, they will notice that there is no water, but also note that there was a QR Code in the tap. People would scan the QR code and start their experience. The app would guide the them to the kitchen, where they would be requested to inform their favorite foods. Next, by pointing their camera to the table, the food will start to disappear from the picture (using image techniques) showing how much of their favorite foods will cease to exist in a situation where there is not enough water. At this moment, individuals are informed that there is a back garden in this house where all the food is available, but only “Water Champions” are able to access that area of the house. A prompt appears and cites what is expected from a Water Champion, i.e. the type of behaviours that make people successfully save water, and the individual will be invited to “sign a pledge” to become a Water Champion. This is our Liminality stage. Does the person wants to live in this “no-water” reality or wants to move on? Having accepted to become a Champion, the person is brought to the back garden where there are a variety of food and where the individual can see through the app how much water is needed to grow each plant under varied weather conditions. Unfortunately that was all the time we had, so no bringing people back to reality smoothly. In any case, it was a fun exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish the workshop, all participants were invited to present the experiences they have designed and to reflect on the elements used in it. We also came to learn that the eye scanning at the beginning of the workshop was just our own Liminality stage 😉&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surprise, surprise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you like the concept of Rites of Passage? Do you know how to apply it in an academic experience (not lecture or presentation anymore)? If so, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to drop your ideas at the comments section below or reach me out at Tweeter. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using storytelling to engage learners</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning is fun, but it is even more interesting when entertainment and learning get together to boost each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next workshop in my series of reflections on the &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/Reflections_on_jTEL_Summer_School_2019_A_Blog_Series-2019-06-16/&quot;&gt;jTEL Summer School 2019&lt;/a&gt; is on “Creating Storified Online Courses”. Despite never having created an online course myself, I hoped to use the knowledge from this workshop on my own presentations and workshops. Thankfully, the team I worked with chose a topic I love to talk about and teach (even if informally at the moment). So, as my Irish friends would say: “Happy Days!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=11YA0W6feiSV1F416y5WZUAxsSIEOze2g&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storytelling is all about creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop started with a presentation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hagedorncm&quot;&gt;Christiane Hagedorn &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the Hasso Plattner Institute, on her experience in creating storified online courses. She introduced the proposal of having an optional story running together with a course on Object Oriented Programming in Java. In this story, there is a villain that needs to be stopped and the students need to code to support the activities of a character fighting against this villain. Each coding exercise relates to the story, but students can still skip the story altogether if they wish so and still be able to do the exercises. She also shared her experience in blending this online storytelling with activities in the real world, such as doing treasure hunting via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geocaching.com/play&quot;&gt;Geocaching&lt;/a&gt;, an online website that provides story for real world treasure hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this short presentation, the class was divided into two groups. Each group should create a story to support a course of their choice. In our group, the topic was chosen due to Vilma Sukacke’s experience in teaching Research Methods and my, secret (no, not really), personal interest in the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=1kqUE5Ya77on4fF26P9J0MMAuaG7pkE3z&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small sample of my books on methods and methodologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as it is a learning course, we needed to decide what is the target audience and the learning goals. The target audience chosen was composed of undergraduate students (but could easily be PhD students) and the four of us chose the learning goals to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to define the research problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to identify existing research methods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to design an approach to tackle the research problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to apply the (research methods) theory in practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of our story should be to support the student in achieving these learning goals in a (hopefully) fun way. So, following the guidance of our workshop facilitator we opted for a Harry Potter style story, with the student arriving at the first day to the “School of Researchers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=1U9jnbS5GERy7C95HIM-bBet-e6ErMaBU&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image from Harry Potter Movie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the first day in the School of Researchers, every student needs to attend an initiation ceremony (much like the induction event in our Universities or just like the Sorting Hat ceremony in Harry Potter) where each student will choose to which research topic they will dedicate their studies in the School. At that point, the student needs to give a name to their topic and a simple explanation on what the research topic is. Having chosen the topic, the student moves to the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=1E0BJfj9tscdTfliHCE6-AHt1tQ7folYj&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image from Harry Potter Movie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second day, the student wakes up at the sound of protests going on in front of the School and it seems the reason for that is the topic the student has chosen. Some people are against it and some people are supporting it. The student then needs to learn what people have been saying about the research topic. The student needs to talk with others and go to the library (looking for related literature) to identify what is been said about the topic and uncover what is the research problem causing all this confusion. When the student has finally managed to identify the topic, describe it and identify what others have talked about it, our first learning goal has been achieved – be able to define the research problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the student has managed to calm down the confusion around the School by clarifying to everyone what is the real research problem and how it relates to what people have been saying, the classes finally start. The student is then introduced to three new teachers: &lt;em&gt;Quantum&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Qualis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mix&lt;/em&gt; (I invented these names today). Quantum teaches the Quantitative Methods class and has a very factual way of communicating with students, always talking through numbers and facts. The Qualis teacher is very different though. Qualis is responsible for the Qualitative Methods class and is always daydreaming and saying that we need to hear people’s expressions and opinions. Finally, there is Mix, the Mixed Methods teacher. Mix has a strong disturb of personality, sometimes acting pretty much like Quantum, sometimes being a lot like Qualis. To pass this stage of the story, students need to attend the classes and figure out at the corridors of the School of Researchers who is coming along and how to talk with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that was all we could do with the time we had available. Therefore, our third and fourth learning goals were not covered and our story remains incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=1on7Esvns2rZaLCxxxUsCJ5pHOM_Vz3jM&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our team's notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main takeaway from this workshop was that we should always take a bit more time to see how we can convert our classes and workshops in something fun, remembering that the notion of fun will depend a lot on the audience. Many people do not really like games, but they would happily engage in a gamified context if it looks ‘serious’ and ‘business-like’ enough. What I still miss, and I have given it as a feedback in the workshop, are some basic elements that we could use to start generating storified courses. What should we be thinking about? What are the basic elements any storified course should have? I think I should go back to my Gamification and Storytelling books, time permitting, and check for a few clues there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my experience in the Creating Storified Online Courses Workshop. Did you like our story? Would you like to implement it in your classroom? How do you think our student will survive and thrive in the School of Researchers? Looking forward to read your opinion and ideas in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning through making and public reflection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a strong believer in learning through the engagement of the full self, not just cognition engaged with (usually poor) visual content (written or image) or (usually boring) audio content. For this reason, I was really looking forward to the “Introduction to Constructionism and Learning-by-Making” Workshop at the &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/Reflections_on_jTEL_Summer_School_2019_A_Blog_Series-2019-06-16/&quot;&gt;jTEL Summer School 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JTELSS19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JTELSS19&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mwycher?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@mwycher&lt;/a&gt; and I are prepping for our Learning-by-Making workshop with cool gadgets for you to try. It&amp;#39;d be helpful for us to know who is interested in coming, so please sign up to the slack channel &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/w23_constructionism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#w23_constructionism&lt;/a&gt;. See you on June 6, room A, at 5.30pm! ☀️🇮🇹 🏖️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fcQjQTRo3F&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/fcQjQTRo3F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anna Vasilchenko (@AnnaVasilchenko) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnnaVasilchenko/status/1131588055498936321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 23, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the learning-by-making workshop was to demonstrate how Computational Thinking can be developed through the process of making a computational application. In this case, not only the development of a software in a screen, but through the interaction with a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://microbit.org/&quot;&gt;Micro:bit sensors&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phidgets.com&quot;&gt;Phidgets&lt;/a&gt; while making &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254522&quot;&gt;Joycap&lt;/a&gt;, a prototype of a game controller for players with sever motor impairment, and with Raspberry Pi at small projects at home, I have never played with Micro:bits and I was looking forward to hear about its connection with Learning-by-Making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to using Micro:bits, this workshop had an additional challenge to me: Appearing in front of the camera and making the video public! Despite having come a long way in decreasing my anxiety during presentations, creating videos is still very uncomfortable to me. So, nothing better than just make one and publish it!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgflip.com/2uo3cm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meme source: https://i.imgflip.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop was organised in three parts: lecture, group work, and reflection. The lecture part was rather short. It was interesting to hear from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mwycher&quot;&gt;Megan Venn-Wycherley &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , from the University of Newcastle, on her experience teaching kids to develop Computational Thinking while playing with Micro:bits. It was very similar to the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CoderDojoGalway&quot;&gt;Coder Dojo Galway &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in developing games using &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt; to teach Computational Thinking to primary school kids, but more physical. In fact, the type of “programming” we used during the workshop was block-based, which is the same type used by Scratch. After the workshop, Megan also told me that Micro:bits can, in fact, be used with Scratch. So.. here I go to an online store to buy some Micro:bits..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Megan’s presentation, it was time for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnnaVasilchenko&quot;&gt;Anna Vasilchenko &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also from the University of Newcastle, to explore the importance of making video tutorials as a process of reflection about learning. I found this idea really nice! This whole process of reflection is what made me finally have courage to “create” this website and as a bonus I also had courage to feature in our video tutorial (very well directed and recorded by &lt;a href=&quot;Frank_Loglo&quot;&gt;Frank Loglo &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Constructionism in practice. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnnaVasilchenko?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@AnnaVasilchenko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mwycher?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Mwycher&lt;/a&gt; bringing the concept of “learning by doing “ to life through the use of micobits. &lt;br /&gt;Great presentation!👏🏽👏🏽&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jtelss?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jtelss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JTELSS19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JTELSS19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/M7q11F8pPo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/M7q11F8pPo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Frank Senyo Loglo (@Frank_Loglo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Frank_Loglo/status/1136684333874462721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 6, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a short presentation, most of the time of the workshop was used to work on a group project using Micro:bits. Our project was to make “Motion Controlled Lights” or, in other words, make a set of LED lights change colour following the movement we make on the Micro:bit board. After having achieved that, we should make a short video explaining the process. Needless to say that we faced a few bugs during the process but we were still able to complete our project within the 30 minutes slot. Great team, great fun and I am happy with the final video. Thank you Frank, Isaac and Anna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our short presentation on the Motion Controlled Lights micro:bits project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reflection part was a short discussion on what we liked/disliked on the workshop. The main takeaways for me were: the importance of reflection in the learning process (more on that in a future post) with public reflection being even better because you can then learn by teaching others on how and what you have learned; making something is a very fun way of learning (which I already knew 😉); and learning-by-making allows learning by trial-and-error that is something that lecture+exams do not allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you? Have you tried using Micro:bits before? Or perhaps you have some tips for who would like to make videos but does not feel confident to be in front of the camera!? Feel free to leave your ideas at the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;
