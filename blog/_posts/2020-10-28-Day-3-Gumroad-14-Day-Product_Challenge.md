Today I have narrowed down the topic of my product (Communication and Engagement) with the help of my prospective audience. I created a poll on Twitter listing three common communication problems faced by researchers, in particular early career ones, and asked what they find the worst one. 

<center>{% twitter https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1321185998844383232 %}</center>

After having received 60 votes, the result was: "I know what I want to say, I just can't write it!".

There were three learnings here:

1. The results are exactly as I expected, what may mean I know a little bit about this specific audience. 
2. Even after I close the poll people still interact with the Tweet, which means I could have gathered more answers may I have let it run longer.
3. I really need to respect the "engagement time" of my audience. I know when this specific audience is around Twitter since they are mostly in Europe and Australia. If I tweet at USA times (following the timeline of the challenge) I get almost no engagement.


Now, having chosen the problem I will tackle, it is time to outline the product I want to offer. For now I have gone through the route of creating a single ebook, but I do like the idea of having an e-book with a hands-on supplement, or even having a video related to the content (following on the footsteps of [Philip Kiely](https://philipkiely.com/notes/14_day_product.html)). I am just not sure I can deliver all these within the 14 days of the challenge so I will keep it 'small'.

**The product (working description):** Aiming at solving common writing problems faced by PhD students and early career researchers, "I know what I want to say, I just can't write it!" Mindset strategies to bring ideas from mind to paper is an e-book that addresses writer's block and the feeling of being overwhelmed with too many ideas. By applying a mindset-driven framework to writing, coupled with practical strategies, this e-book brings a methodology that leads the reader from concept expression to a first draft without feeling overwhelmed. Use the 5 writing mindsets methodology today and start writing.
