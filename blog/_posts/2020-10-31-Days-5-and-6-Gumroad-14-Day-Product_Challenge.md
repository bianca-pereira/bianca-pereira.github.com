These last two days I have focused on creating the first draft of the e-book:

>***"I know what I want to say, I just can't write it!"***
>
>**Mindset strategies to bring ideas from mind to paper**

My main goal is to have the content of the product ready, have some early feedback on it and then I decide on format and book cover.

So far I have focused on unpacking the problem given in the title of the book (*"I know what I want to say, I just can't write it!"*), explaining three possible causes for that feeling. Then I come into chapter 2 listing good well-intended advice that just does not work :)

I have never thought about "the voice" for the book, I just faced that when starting drafting. It started "too academic and distant", when I wanted something more "personal" since the book is a personal take on a problem I faced multiple times and have helped other people with the same issues. When writing a blog post I tend to give me own personal perspective, when writing an academic article I let the content take precedence. For the book I really was not sure how I wanted to write. I ended up writing more like "my advice for you", which is a voice I don't really like. I prefer more "this is my experience and I am sharing it with you". So, despite having drafted two chapters, I may still change the tone all over the place.

Meanwhile I am also engaging with my target audience, not only for "sales purposes" but to keep engaging on the discussions, learning from them and also adding value where I can. In addition I have also planned some talks on the content of the book, what may help me promote it and get feedback. Let's see how it goes :)
