The first day of the Gumroad 14 Day Product challenge was all about identifying what is the product we want to create.

To identify what I will be creating I have applied two strategies:

1. Public brainstorming.
2. Requests for Feedback

## Public Brainstorming

For Day 1 I decided to go for a public brainstorm of ideas on Twitter:

As I have knowledge in different areas I find it really hard to decide on what I want to focus first (that has always being my problem). So I decided to brainstorm something in all areas:

First, some of the learnings I got in participating in **academia-industry project collaborations**.

My **experience with quitting a PhD** (for not knowing a lot of stuff and having a hard time) to **starting again** a part-time PhD **3 years later** (now with WAY more knowledge):

My experience in starting a **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion** committee in a highly hierarchical institution where I was at the bottom of the hierarchy. Also, how to add these values into software-related projects:

Finally, some vague ideas around my research **topic of expertise**:

## Requests for Feedback

Having had a public brainstorm, without real intention on getting feedback from that. I contacted a group of friends with the following request:

> Hi =) I am participating in the #14DayProduct challenge where we need to create a product (an e-book, an experience sharing course, a how-to or something like that) in 14 days.
>
>I am reaching out to my friends for some help: If I could teach you anything that I know. What would you like to learn about?

Let's see what I will learn from them :)
