Then I come into chapter 2 listing good well-intended advice that just does not work :) I have never thought about “the voice” for the book, I just faced that when starting drafting. It started “too academic and distant”, when I wanted something more “personal” since the book is a personal take on a problem I faced multiple times and have helped other people with the same issues. When writing a blog post I tend to give me own personal perspective, when writing an academic article I let the content take precedence. For the book I really was not sure how I wanted to write. I ended up writing more like “my advice for you”, which is a voice I don’t really like. I prefer more “this is my experience and I am sharing it with you”. So, despite having drafted two chapters, I may still change the tone all over the place. Meanwhile I am also engaging with my target audience, not only for “sales purposes” but to keep engaging on the discussions, learning from them and also adding value where I can. In addition I have also planned some talks on the content of the book, what may help me promote it and get feedback. Let’s see how it goes :) "

As a #PhD student, which of these you see as your worst challenge?1. I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!2. I just gave a presentation , but no one seems to have understood it. 3.

There were three learnings here:  The results are exactly as I expected, what may mean I know a little bit about this specific audience.  Even after I close the poll people still interact with the Tweet, which means I could have gathered more answers may I have let it run longer.  I really need to respect the “engagement time” of my audience. I know when this specific audience is around Twitter since they are mostly in Europe and Australia. If I tweet at USA times (following the timeline of the challenge) I get almost no engagement. Now, having chosen the problem I will tackle, it is time to outline the product I want to offer. For now I have gone through the route of creating a single ebook, but I do like the idea of having an e-book with a hands-on supplement, or even having a video related to the content (following on the footsteps of Philip Kiely). I am just not sure I can deliver all these within the 14 days of the challenge so I will keep it ‘small’. The product (working description): Aiming at solving common writing problems faced by PhD students and early career researchers, “I know what I want to say, I just can’t write it!” Mindset strategies to bring ideas from mind to paper is an e-book that addresses writer’s block and the feeling of being overwhelmed with too many ideas.

It also called my attention because I have already some content structured for talks and workshops I gave in the past, so it would be mostly about converting it into an e-book. Today, I decided to break the topic into 3 problems that researchers (my audience) usually face and added as a poll on Twitter: As a #PhD student, which of these you see as your worst challenge?1.

Gumroad is a platform that supports creators in launching and selling their products. From their own website:  Creators deserve to get paid for their work. We make it easy. The 14 Day Product Challenge consists of choosing an audience and building a small info product (e. g. a book, a video, a course, a template, a piece of code) that adds value to that audience. The participants in the challenge are expected to work a little bit everyday on their projects and share their journey with other participants in the challenge. Meanwhile, the organisers send a daily email with tips on how to move the product forward step-by-step. Gumroad  14 Day Product Guide  to be released at the end of the challenge. Taking the opportunity that I am off work next week, I will have a bit of time to dedicate to this idea. Although I do not expect to be launching any product by the end of 14 days (given all my other commitments), I still expect to have had as much progress as I can in this timeline and have at least a draft product ready to share with some “early enthusiasts” :) Let’s see what I can do!

    "title": "Multimodality and the change in meaning.",
    "body": "2019/06/27 - Humans do not make meaning just by using their eyes, just by using their ears, or just by tactile sensations. Instead, humans make meaning by aggregating the input we receive from all our sensors. In this blog post I will talk about multimodality and meaning making by sharing my experience in attending the Multimodal Tutor workshop at the JTELSS2019. To check my reflections on other workshops in this Summer School, check my previous post. Multimodal Tutor by @dimstudi0 and @SuperHeroBooth at #jtelss19 A well-developed approach and tools, engaging presentation, impressive demonstrations and very serious challenges addressed!=&gt; full room of participants, as expected!https://t. co/bJXCe1XUhg pic. twitter. com/Lbkl3U6oXh &mdash; JTELSS (@jtelss) June 6, 2019In Computer Science, and Technology-Enhanced Learning, the term modality refers to “a particular form of sensory perception” (according to a particularly good definition given by Google dictionary). For instance, image is a modality, audio is another modality, etc. Therefore, when talking about multimodality, we are talking about aggregating multiple types of sensorial information. In this workshop, we were given a few good examples on how data in one modality can completely change the interpretation generated by data from another modality, and we learned what are the work of the workshop organisers in promoting multimodality for learning analytics. The workshop was organised using a lecture-style presentation with the introduction of catchy examples and interesting demos. The first presenter was Jan Schneider , from the Open University in Netherlands, showing through multiple examples how the addition of a modality can change the interpretation given to a piece of data so far. In one of these examples he played an audio file and asked us which instrument was been played. By the sound of it, most people suggested it was a violin, however, when pairing the audio with a video of a person playing the instrument we could see that it was, in fact, a saw!!     If you had your eyes closed, would you say it is not a violin? On another example, Jan showed how a video sequence from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean could receive completely different interpretations depending on the audio that goes with it. So, having motivated us on how adding a new modality can change our interpretation of data, Jan passed the stage to Daniele di Mitri. 	  	Example on how the audio modality can change the meaning of the video modality. Daniele di Mitri , also from the Open University in Netherlands, presented the potential of multimodality for the development of intelligent tutoring systems. He started by introducing how the concept of multimodality applies to computers: whereas humans have a series of natural sensors (e. g. ear, eye, mouth, skin) and use them to interpret the world around them, computers also deal with data coming from a multitude of sensors (e. g. camera, audio record, GPS, light sensors) and can use them to capture semantic information (i. e. meaning) about a given context. When computers are able to observe, through their sensors, how humans behave while learning a given task (e. g. the type of mistakes humans are making) and make sense of what they perceive, then computers will become more equipped at supporting humans on how to learn effectively. In order to make this vision a reality, Daniele argues that, in learning analytics, it is not enough to provide computers with sensorial data. Instead, computers also need to reason about elements that are not embedded in the signals themselves, such as beliefs, emotions, cognition, or motivation. In Machine Learning terms, we need to provide computers with annotated training data, i. e. an association between a set of sensorial data and interpretations on what this data means in terms of metacognition, etc. By having such training data, one could train a machine learning model to predict what is being demonstrated by the behaviour of a learner. One challenge in the training of machine learning algorithms based on multimodal data is that there is not enough multimodal data annotated. 		Daniele's slide on how sensorial data needs to be paired with interpretation. In order to support the generation of annotation of multimodal data, Daniele presents his Visual Inspection Tool . This tool was developed to allow humans to synchronise data from multiple modalities and perform manual annotations (i. e. provide interpretations for the data) based on this aggregated data. One example given during the workshop was the use of this tool to annotate data about students learning how to perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a life saving procedure). Current CPR training involves the use of dolls containing multiple sensors so, when the student performs CPR in the doll, a series of data points are collected and used to provide feedback to the learner. However, Daniele points that such solution is limited since it does not capture certain body postures the student needs to have while performing CPR (e. g. arms locked rather than arms relaxed). By synchronising a video with the sensor data coming from the doll, one can verify if such body postures are applied or not, and even identify to which movement performed during CPR each sensor data coming from the doll refers to. Such tool provides as a result multimodal data annotated by humans and ready to use within machine learning algorithms. 		Daniele's slide presenting the Visual Inspection Tool To close the workshop, Bibeg Limbu , also from Open University in Netherlands, presented additional applications for multimodal data in learning environments: first an application that aims at detecting if a learner has achieved the state of flow while performing a given learning activity, and another application to support students in learning calligraphy. He then followed with a discussion on which modalities should be used to provide feedback to a learner: should we use one of the modalities the learner is currently engaged with? Or should we provide feedback using a completely different modality? For instance, if someone is learning calligraphy through an app then their vision and motor modalities are in use during the task, should the feedback be visual (in use in the task) or auditory (not currently in use within the task)? 		Daniele's slide presenting the Learning Pulse tool This workshop was interesting to me for two reasons: first I got to learn a bit about multimodality and it got me thinking if and how I could apply it to my work; and second I got some interesting insights for my PhD by observing how Daniele has translated his PhD studies into multiple publications. Regarding the second item, I will save my comments to when I start my series of posts on my PhD practice. The most I would say now is that I got some ideas on how I could publish my Conceptual Model and I increased my confidence to publish a Literature Review. Regarding the use of multimodality in my work, I do not see immediate application but it got me thinking: How can text be used in the context of multimodality? An obvious answer that came to mind was: in the detection of irony. Irony is something really hard to detect if one is using only text. My understanding is that we, as humans, detect irony mostly by observing discrepancies between the content of a message and changes in the speaker’s voice (e. g. speaking more slowly or with a different pitch in the voice) or facial expressions (e. g. roll the eyes). The problem with text is that it contains only the message, but not the ways in which irony is transmitted. In order to transmit irony in text, one needs to make more or less clear, by explaining the context, that a piece of text is ironic. 		It is hard to detect irony in text. . . So, apart from detection of irony, I am not sure how else text could enter in the multimodality story. Any ideas? Feel free to discuss at the comments section below. "

This is one more post in my reflections about the 15th EATEL Summer School on Technology Enhanced Learning (JTELSS). I suppose that, from all workshops, this was the most impactful for me and I explain you why. #MixedReality workshop with @CGNfil and Jonas Zimmer presting the #portapraetoria project visualizing ancient #cologne #JTELSS19 @CologneGameLab pic. twitter. com/JMxcxr1ep7 &mdash; Roland Klemke (@rklemke) June 4, 2019When organising my presentations, I don’t like to think that I will “give a talk”. Saying that sounds as if I will be talking whatever I want to say, whereas people in the ‘audience’ need to be there just listening and waiting me to finish and leave (sounds familiar!?). Instead, I prefer to think that I will “create an experience”. By creating an experience, now we have participants rather than an audience. People will feel, think, imagine, remember, talk or do something. This workshop gave me some hints on how to help people to smoothly change from their current reality (in this case their everyday life with the work they were just doing and/or still thinking about) into an alternative reality (i. e. a ‘world’ of ideas we will co-create during our time together). The workshop started in a very odd way. The organisers asked to scan our iris in order to register us for the workshop. It felt weird because I could see that it was so dark at the room that the phone camera could barely capture my eyes, even less detect my iris or anything else in that picture. Later I went to learn what it was all about. 		Why are you scanning my iris? Having our eyes scanned, the workshop started with an extremely interesting presentation topic. Katharina Tillmans , from Cologne Game Lab, started by introducing the Reality-Virtuality continuum. She explained that each of our experiences fall somewhere between Absolute Reality and Virtual Reality in this continuum. According to her, we never really get to experience Absolute Virtuality because, well. . we exist in the real world. . right? (Unless you believe in The Matrix, but that is another discussion). Therefore, each of our experiences using technology is more or less virtual. The problem, she claims, is that our current technological experiences create gaps in what should be a continuum space. For instance, when we use our phones to scan a QR code, at the first point in time we are in the reality and at a second point in time, BOOM, we are already within the virtual world navigatin some website or acessing a given app. Katharina points that the lack of a smooth transition between levels of reality is what creates a gap. The work of the workshop organisers is to improve people’s experiences by creating smooth transitions between levels of reality-virtuality and, consequently, removing this transition gap. 		We never really get to experience Absolute Virtuality. Slides from Katharina Tillmans. In order to fill the gaps in the reality-virtuality continuum, Katharina presented the idea of “Rites of Passage”. She explains that human life has a few common rites of passage (e. g. birth, marriage, childbirth and death) and that in each of these rites we pass through three stages: Separation, Liminality, and Incorporation. The first stage is the “Separation”, when one gets separated from their old self. She gives marriage as an example, where, depending on the culture, the groom and bride have bachelor and bachelorette parties with their friends in order to celebrate the end of their time as unmarried individuals. They are basically saying goodbye to their old selves. The second stage is the “Liminality”. It is the moment of transition into the new identity; it is the moment when one chooses to make the transition. In the marriage example, it happens when someone has the wedding ceremony and shares the vows or signs the marriage contract. At this moment, the individual takes the definitive decision into transitioning to the new self. The third and last stage is the “Incorporation”, where individuals start to get into the new role they chose. For instance, it is when the two newly weds start to accept and embed in their lives the idea of being a married couple. As I understand, at this stage the individual goes back to the world but with a different perspective on it and a new identity. Katharina claims that these three stages can be used to bring users from the absolute reality smoothly into the virtual reality. 		The stages of a Rite of Passage The next presenter was Jonas Zimmer. He presents the Porta Praetoria project where the concept of Rites of Passage is used to teach children, through a game on their phones, about the life of the romans who lived in Cologne, Germany centuries ago. In this project, children start the Separation stage by inviting their friends to make a group of 3 explorers, downloading the app and deciding what will be the role of each player (navigator, excavator, or puzzle maker). Then, still in the Separation stage, the navigator guides the group to a given physical spot in the real world. At that spot, through the use of augmented reality technology, the group can see through the navigator’s camera that there is a portal at a specific point in the space. At this moment the “Liminality” is activated. Should the children cross the portal and move further in the virtuality continuum, or stay where they are? The navigator is the one who can see the portal and needs to physically go to the place and cross it. The other two members of the team can only pass through the portal if the navigator invites them in. Having chosen to pass the “Liminality”, i. e. having crossed the portal, the children now can see the city through augmented reality as it was at roman times in that specific location. Then, within this virtual world, they are in the “Incorporation” stage, where they are now explorers of the history of the Roman Empire. Note that we do not bring the kids so far just to abandon them in the virtual world. Instead, the way back is also smooth. Do you remember we still have an excavator and a puzzle maker in this story? After having observed how romans lived, the kids need to choose to cross the portal back to the reality in order to discover the artefacts the romans left behind. The excavator needs to use the app to find buried pieces of artefacts (e. g. vases, plates, cups), whereas the puzzle maker needs to assemble these pieces in their original form, i. e. rebuild the artefacts. The journey of our team guides them through the city and finishes at the local museum, where our explorers are brought back to reality by observing the real artefact they just built in the virtual world. 	  	A video demo of Porta Praetoria project I mean… I love this story!! But it did not stop there. After the presentation, we were all divided into groups to design an experience that takes advantage of the concepts we just learned about. The challenge was: “How can we create an experience that support people living in Bari to save water?”. Our group came up with the idea of starting by showing how would be the world if we did not have enough water. As this post is getting too long, I will try to summarise. People would be invited to enter a house and try to wash their hands. By turning the tap, they will notice that there is no water, but also note that there was a QR Code in the tap. People would scan the QR code and start their experience. The app would guide the them to the kitchen, where they would be requested to inform their favorite foods. Next, by pointing their camera to the table, the food will start to disappear from the picture (using image techniques) showing how much of their favorite foods will cease to exist in a situation where there is not enough water. At this moment, individuals are informed that there is a back garden in this house where all the food is available, but only “Water Champions” are able to access that area of the house. A prompt appears and cites what is expected from a Water Champion, i. e. the type of behaviours that make people successfully save water, and the individual will be invited to “sign a pledge” to become a Water Champion. This is our Liminality stage. Does the person wants to live in this “no-water” reality or wants to move on? Having accepted to become a Champion, the person is brought to the back garden where there are a variety of food and where the individual can see through the app how much water is needed to grow each plant under varied weather conditions. Unfortunately that was all the time we had, so no bringing people back to reality smoothly. In any case, it was a fun exercise. 		Presentation of our design. Photo by Mikhail Fominykh To finish the workshop, all participants were invited to present the experiences they have designed and to reflect on the elements used in it. We also came to learn that the eye scanning at the beginning of the workshop was just our own Liminality stage 😉 		Surprise, surprise! Did you like the concept of Rites of Passage? Do you know how to apply it in an academic experience (not lecture or presentation anymore)? If so, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to drop your ideas at the comments section below or reach me out at Tweeter. Cheers! "

    "title": "Using storytelling to engage learners",
    "body": "2019/06/20 - Learning is fun, but it is even more interesting when entertainment and learning get together to boost each other. The next workshop in my series of reflections on the jTEL Summer School 2019 is on “Creating Storified Online Courses”. Despite never having created an online course myself, I hoped to use the knowledge from this workshop on my own presentations and workshops. Thankfully, the team I worked with chose a topic I love to talk about and teach (even if informally at the moment). So, as my Irish friends would say: “Happy Days!” Storytelling is all about creativity. The workshop started with a presentation by Christiane Hagedorn , from the Hasso Plattner Institute, on her experience in creating storified online courses. She introduced the proposal of having an optional story running together with a course on Object Oriented Programming in Java. In this story, there is a villain that needs to be stopped and the students need to code to support the activities of a character fighting against this villain. Each coding exercise relates to the story, but students can still skip the story altogether if they wish so and still be able to do the exercises. She also shared her experience in blending this online storytelling with activities in the real world, such as doing treasure hunting via Geocaching, an online website that provides story for real world treasure hunting. After this short presentation, the class was divided into two groups. Each group should create a story to support a course of their choice. In our group, the topic was chosen due to Vilma Sukacke’s experience in teaching Research Methods and my, secret (no, not really), personal interest in the topic. A small sample of my books on methods and methodologies. First, as it is a learning course, we needed to decide what is the target audience and the learning goals. The target audience chosen was composed of undergraduate students (but could easily be PhD students) and the four of us chose the learning goals to be:  Be able to define the research problem Be able to identify existing research methods Be able to design an approach to tackle the research problem Be able to apply the (research methods) theory in practiceThe purpose of our story should be to support the student in achieving these learning goals in a (hopefully) fun way. So, following the guidance of our workshop facilitator we opted for a Harry Potter style story, with the student arriving at the first day to the “School of Researchers”. Image from Harry Potter Movie. At the first day in the School of Researchers, every student needs to attend an initiation ceremony (much like the induction event in our Universities or just like the Sorting Hat ceremony in Harry Potter) where each student will choose to which research topic they will dedicate their studies in the School. At that point, the student needs to give a name to their topic and a simple explanation on what the research topic is. Having chosen the topic, the student moves to the next day. Image from Harry Potter Movie. In the second day, the student wakes up at the sound of protests going on in front of the School and it seems the reason for that is the topic the student has chosen. Some people are against it and some people are supporting it. The student then needs to learn what people have been saying about the research topic. The student needs to talk with others and go to the library (looking for related literature) to identify what is been said about the topic and uncover what is the research problem causing all this confusion. When the student has finally managed to identify the topic, describe it and identify what others have talked about it, our first learning goal has been achieved – be able to define the research problem. When the student has managed to calm down the confusion around the School by clarifying to everyone what is the real research problem and how it relates to what people have been saying, the classes finally start. The student is then introduced to three new teachers: Quantum, Qualis, and Mix (I invented these names today). Quantum teaches the Quantitative Methods class and has a very factual way of communicating with students, always talking through numbers and facts. The Qualis teacher is very different though. Qualis is responsible for the Qualitative Methods class and is always daydreaming and saying that we need to hear people’s expressions and opinions. Finally, there is Mix, the Mixed Methods teacher. Mix has a strong disturb of personality, sometimes acting pretty much like Quantum, sometimes being a lot like Qualis. To pass this stage of the story, students need to attend the classes and figure out at the corridors of the School of Researchers who is coming along and how to talk with them. Unfortunately that was all we could do with the time we had available. Therefore, our third and fourth learning goals were not covered and our story remains incomplete. Our team's notes My main takeaway from this workshop was that we should always take a bit more time to see how we can convert our classes and workshops in something fun, remembering that the notion of fun will depend a lot on the audience. Many people do not really like games, but they would happily engage in a gamified context if it looks ‘serious’ and ‘business-like’ enough. What I still miss, and I have given it as a feedback in the workshop, are some basic elements that we could use to start generating storified courses. What should we be thinking about? What are the basic elements any storified course should have? I think I should go back to my Gamification and Storytelling books, time permitting, and check for a few clues there. That was my experience in the Creating Storified Online Courses Workshop. Did you like our story? Would you like to implement it in your classroom? How do you think our student will survive and thrive in the School of Researchers? Looking forward to read your opinion and ideas in the comments section below. "

    "title": "Learning through making and public reflection",
    "body": "2019/06/20 - I am a strong believer in learning through the engagement of the full self, not just cognition engaged with (usually poor) visual content (written or image) or (usually boring) audio content. For this reason, I was really looking forward to the “Introduction to Constructionism and Learning-by-Making” Workshop at the jTEL Summer School 2019. Hi #JTELSS19!@mwycher and I are prepping for our Learning-by-Making workshop with cool gadgets for you to try. It&#39;d be helpful for us to know who is interested in coming, so please sign up to the slack channel #w23_constructionism.  See you on June 6, room A, at 5. 30pm! ☀️🇮🇹 🏖️ pic. twitter. com/fcQjQTRo3F &mdash; Anna Vasilchenko (@AnnaVasilchenko) May 23, 2019The goal of the learning-by-making workshop was to demonstrate how Computational Thinking can be developed through the process of making a computational application. In this case, not only the development of a software in a screen, but through the interaction with a set of Micro:bit sensors. Despite having played with Phidgets while making Joycap, a prototype of a game controller for players with sever motor impairment, and with Raspberry Pi at small projects at home, I have never played with Micro:bits and I was looking forward to hear about its connection with Learning-by-Making. In addition to using Micro:bits, this workshop had an additional challenge to me: Appearing in front of the camera and making the video public! Despite having come a long way in decreasing my anxiety during presentations, creating videos is still very uncomfortable to me. So, nothing better than just make one and publish it!! Meme source: https://i. imgflip. com The workshop was organised in three parts: lecture, group work, and reflection. The lecture part was rather short. It was interesting to hear from Megan Venn-Wycherley , from the University of Newcastle, on her experience teaching kids to develop Computational Thinking while playing with Micro:bits. It was very similar to the work of Coder Dojo Galway in developing games using Scratch to teach Computational Thinking to primary school kids, but more physical. In fact, the type of “programming” we used during the workshop was block-based, which is the same type used by Scratch. After the workshop, Megan also told me that Micro:bits can, in fact, be used with Scratch. So. . here I go to an online store to buy some Micro:bits. . After Megan’s presentation, it was time for Anna Vasilchenko , also from the University of Newcastle, to explore the importance of making video tutorials as a process of reflection about learning. I found this idea really nice! This whole process of reflection is what made me finally have courage to “create” this website and as a bonus I also had courage to feature in our video tutorial (very well directed and recorded by Frank Loglo , by the way). Constructionism in practice. @AnnaVasilchenko and @Mwycher bringing the concept of “learning by doing “ to life through the use of micobits. Great presentation!👏🏽👏🏽@jtelss #JTELSS19 pic. twitter. com/M7q11F8pPo &mdash; Frank Senyo Loglo (@Frank_Loglo) June 6, 2019Having a short presentation, most of the time of the workshop was used to work on a group project using Micro:bits. Our project was to make “Motion Controlled Lights” or, in other words, make a set of LED lights change colour following the movement we make on the Micro:bit board. After having achieved that, we should make a short video explaining the process. Needless to say that we faced a few bugs during the process but we were still able to complete our project within the 30 minutes slot. Great team, great fun and I am happy with the final video. Thank you Frank, Isaac and Anna.   Our short presentation on the Motion Controlled Lights micro:bits project The reflection part was a short discussion on what we liked/disliked on the workshop. The main takeaways for me were: the importance of reflection in the learning process (more on that in a future post) with public reflection being even better because you can then learn by teaching others on how and what you have learned; making something is a very fun way of learning (which I already knew 😉); and learning-by-making allows learning by trial-and-error that is something that lecture+exams do not allow. What about you? Have you tried using Micro:bits before? Or perhaps you have some tips for who would like to make videos but does not feel confident to be in front of the camera!?

    "title": "Innovative Pedagogy: My reflections on which pedagogies to use for research dissemination.",
    "body": "2019/06/16 - Today’s blog post is on the topic of Innovative Pedagogy and it is my reflection on the keynote of Rebecca Ferguson at the jTEL Summer School 2019. In this post I will talk about the multiple purposes of education and how different pedagogies can support researchers in disseminating their research and managing meetings. Keynote 2 at #JTELSS19: &quot;Innovating pedagogy: enhancing learning&quot; by Rebecca Ferguson @R3beccaF from the Open University. pic. twitter. com/NtHPwETziM &mdash; JTELSS (@jtelss) June 4, 2019I have two points of interest in the topic of Innovative Pedagogy. First, I want to learn which pedagogies I can use at my own presentations (academic or otherwise). Although I am not a teacher on the strict sense at this moment — which means I do not teach in a classroom — I am teaching every time I give a talk, present a (e-)poster or facilitate a workshop. So, what pedagogies could I make use of on my research practice? Second, I work developing software as part of my job as a Computer Science researcher. Or should I say that I develop “computational artefacts”? Then the following question comes to mind: is there any type of pedagogy that would provide better support to users of these software applications? In other words, should we even think in terms of ‘pedagogies embedded in software’? Despite my interest on this question, this is a thought that I still need to explore further (any references? Send them to me please). Therefore, in this post I will only cover my first topic of interest.  Rebecca Ferguson's presentation slides The talk of Rebecca Ferguson , a Senior Lecturer at the Open University in UK, starts by arguing that education serves many purposes, in contradiction to some people that assume education serves only to ensure employability (Did anyone say Bolsonaro!?). In addition to employability, education also serves the purpose of: taking our place in society by becoming responsible citizens with social and emotional skills, building communities through inclusion and learning-by-making, improving our health through reflection on our experiences and change in behaviours, and learning to question by questioning the world in order to learn. So, education is more than just preparation for the job market, it is also to teach our kids, teenagers and adults to be humans and critical citizens. Among this whole discourse of ‘fake news’ and the increasing amount of suicides worldwide, it is hard to disagree with Rebecca that we need schools to fulfil those other purposes of education. But, despite good intentions, how can teachers make it practical? &quot;From learner to earner&quot; Rebecca Ferguson on Higher Ed and EdTech, a provocation: is that all? And from then on, she opens to a world of other educational endeavours that we shouldn&#39;t leave behind #JTELSS19 pic. twitter. com/id3NTzL2IH &mdash; Juliana Raffaghelli (@JulianaR71) June 4, 2019In the second part of this keynote talk, Rebecca presents a set of pedagogies that can be used in the classroom to achieve the multiple purposes of education. In fact, her team at the Open University has been releasing a series of booklets on innovative pedagogies that could (and probably will) impact learning and teaching. From a total of 70 pedagogies published over the years, she focused on the 8 pedagogies most related to technology: spaced learning, computational thinking, epistemic education, threshold concepts, flipped classroom, intergroup empathy, intergroup empathy, making thinking visible, and learning with robots. Innovating Pedagogy 2019 Booklet Cover Since the booklets have an excellent explanation for each pedagogy, I will not explain them in this blog post. Instead, I will just cite what I found interesting in each one and how they can be used in research practice. Spaced Learning. This pedagogy reminds me of some marketing strategies. The more you talk about something in small chunks of conversations and presentations, the more people have the feeling that they know it. The whole idea of spaced learning as a pedagogy is to divide content delivery in small chunks and intertwine them with other (completely unrelated) activities. This can be very useful for disseminating research and, to be honest, I have used this quite a bit in the past. Research is hard to communicate because we are creating new concepts that people do not quite understand yet. So, we need to break it into small chunks that people can “digest”. You can discuss your main topic with someone, then give a presentation, then send a related email, then post on social media. If your message is clear (but not just repetitive), people will start to remember they have heard it before and they will start to learn about your research. As soon as they learn, it becomes their own concept as well and they will start disseminating it and engaging with your research concepts. Computational Thinking. This is a pedagogy widely used here in Ireland. My great friend Brendan Smith has gone around the country promoting the idea that primary school children should “learn how to code”, or in better terms, develop Computational Thinking. This is the basis of the Galway’s Coder Dojo workshops using Scratch and our in-house workshops at the Data Science Institute using AppInventor.  Rebecca's slide on Computational Thinking Epistemic Education. This pedagogy, as I understand it, supports the idea of looking at multiple perspectives when analysing a given situation. It is a very useful tool to decrease the polarisation currently happening in social media and the lack of critical thinking in our society. But I doubt it would have much efficiency without people developing Empathy as well. When it comes to research, I cannot stress how important it is to look at a piece of evidence/data through different perspectives. I suppose that this is the whole point of doing research and having academic presentations and debates. So, the takeaway message is: Always analyse your data, papers and presentations using different perspectives, in particular those who disagree with you. You never know what you can learn from that. Threshold Concepts. The key message of this pedagogy is to support learners with concepts they struggle to understand through the means of collaboration and mapping of ideas. To be honest I did not fully understand this pedagogy, but I suppose it is to provide mapping tools so that learners can map the new concept to other concepts they already have. This may show clashes between the new concept and their current assumptions and may help them to integrate the new concept with their pre-existent conceptual mental models and experiences. In fact, when preparing a talk about our research, we need to support the audience into mapping our novel concept into their current mental models. So, in a way, threshold concepts is a pedagogy that any good speaker needs to apply to the best of their ability. What if we could take methods of this pedagogy to support the delivery of our talks? That is something I still need to think about… Rebecca's slide on Epistemic Education Flipped Classroom. This is the best strategy for meetings ever!! If people would actually study the material before the meeting… The whole point of Flipped Classroom is that students would study the content of the class at home and use the time of the class for questions and activities. In this way, rather than having to go to class to attend a lecture, students would take advantage of current technologies and watch a video lecture at home as many times as they wish or read materials about the content of the class. Since content is so easy to access these days, the time in the classroom would be used to investigate questions about the content and perform other activities to strengthen students knowledge and skills. Coming back to meetings, it is the equivalent to send some material before the meeting and use the meeting time just for discussions and decisions. In this way, people would have had time to reflect on the topic before the meeting actually happens. The problem is that I do not know what happens if students, or meeting participants in this case, do not engage with the content beforehand. Intergroup Empathy. This was a very interesting pedagogy. The idea here is to use technology to enable people to develop empathy towards others. For instance, one may want to develop empathy towards a refugee, then immersive technology can be used by this person to learn how it feels to spend a day in the life of someone living in a refugee camp. Definitely an interesting pedagogy, but I am still not sure how to use it in my own practice.  Rebecca's slide with the list of pedagogies she discussed in the talk Making Thinking Visible. I love this pedagogy and have been using and teaching it for quite some time already. The idea is to make your thinking visible, as simple as that. I usually promote it through the use of freewriting. PhD students always struggle in communicating their ideas, so they have this feeling that they know what they want to say but that they are not able to say or write it. Therefore in order to deal with this issue, I promote the use of freewriting, i. e. writing down every thought that comes to mind exactly as it comes and without judgment. In this way, students can make their thoughts visible and start questioning, expanding and changing them. Every time I give a workshop on freewriting students report having come up with thoughts they would not have expected and that could help their research move forward. Also, by removing judgment from the process of writing, students have words on the paper that they can now work with and starting communicating their ideas and build their publications. Learning with (Ro)bots.  Learning with robots means either building a robot and learning by interacting with it, or having a conversational partner (i. e. a bot) to whom ask frequent classroom questions or having some study support. Although I love the idea of building bots for learning, I have mixed feelings about it. Without the right pedagogy, the technology can cause a bad experience to learners or even be detrimental to learning. One example of it comes from when I was a kid and the school introduced Logo Turtles in our computer classes. My teachers did not know the pedagogy behind the Logo Turtles so they would just leave us 1 hour “playing” with that. We would ask what we were supposed to do and the maximum they ever said was: “It can go right, left, up and down, and you can rotate it. Just do some drawing if you want”. Nowadays I see how terrible this approach was. They could have thought us many math concepts with that (e. g. perimeter, angles, polygons), but having a piece of technology without having a teacher that understands the pedagogy behind that can actually be detrimental to learning or to student’s experiences. In summary, learning with robots can be very interesting, but only if pedagogically grounded. Rebecca Ferguson from @OpenUniversity presenting the future of Technology Enhanced Learning through a #pedagogy-led innovation at #JTELSS19 #edtech against #fakenews pic. twitter. com/rQFWdkPB2O &mdash; Bianca Pereira | Researcher (@bianca_oli_per) June 4, 2019In summary, education has multiple purposes and, for each purpose, there are multiple pedagogies we can apply. In my work as a researcher, I could identify that at least Spaced Learning, Flipped Classroom, and Making Thinking Visible are three pedagogies I can immediately apply in the organisation of meetings and in research dissemination. What about you, is there any other pedagogy you apply in your research practice? Share your experience at the comment section below or feel free to reach me out at Twitter. "

    "body": "2019/06/16 - This article introduces a series of reflections on my engagement on the jTEL Summer School 2019 activities. In the last post I discussed the importance of summer schools for the formation of PhD students. In this post I will explain the themes I used to chose among the multiple parallel workshops available in the jTEL Summer School 2019. The 15th @eateleu Summer School #JTELSS19 is41 instructors from 14 countries!66 hours of training in 3 parallel sessions46 sessions, including keynotes, workshops and more!The final list of sessions is now available at https://t. co/jsP4IT2ELF pic. twitter. com/Xn7gwvCR0L &mdash; JTELSS (@jtelss) May 22, 2019Originally, my plan was to write one post with my experience in most workshops but it would turn out to be a long reading, so I decided to break it down in a series of blog posts instead. This blog series will be divided into the five themes that I used to decide in which workshops I would participate.    Experiential learning   I have a strong belief that in order to learn we need to engage our whole selves; whereas engaging our minds is a good first step, we also should improve our ways to engage the rest of our bodies as well as feelings. Because of this, I have been trying to include elements of experiential learning on my presentations and I am also interested in learning more on how I can make any ‘normal’ software more engaging and educational. Softwares are tools to support humans, so it is our job to make them more human friendly. The workshops and talks I attended in this theme were:      the keynote talk of Rebecca Fergusson on ‘Innovating Pedagogy: Enhancing Learning’   Introduction to Constructionism and Learning-by-Making   Creating Storified Online Courses   Rites of passage: Creating impactful Scenarios for the Transition in Between Realities in Mixed-Reality   Multimodal Tutor      Self-directed learning   My PhD research is in self-directed learning and my whole research journey is centred around that. So, why did I do two masters in automatic discovery of concepts in Natural Language Text? Many people do not know, but self-directed learning was the driver for it. The workshops and talks I attended in this theme were:      Reflection Guidance - State-of-the-art and Challenges in Intelligent mentoring systems   Am I planning SMART? Exploring learning cycles      Research design   I cannot stress enough how much I like to study research methods and methodologies, but I suppose this is a topic for another blog post. In this theme I included methods, methodologies and theories I could potentially use on my research design. The workshops and talks I attended in this theme were:      Evaluation Methods - Field Studies in Technology-Enhanced Learning   Introductory Epistemic Network Analysis Workshop   How the Blockchain can shape the future of education   The Trialogical Approach: learning through shared objects and technologies.       Current challenges   My research participants are very important to me and these are the people I want my software tools to support. Also, I want to leave a positive impact with my work, therefore I want to ensure my research follows only ethical procedures. My challenge then has been to learn everything I can about ethical research. Sometimes, however, open, engaged and ethical ideologies seem to clash, in particular when we consider all the details of GDPR (the General Data Protection Regulation). So, anything I can learn on these topics and their interaction is always welcome. The workshops and talks I attended in this theme were:      Research ethics and informed consent   Opening up TEL Research: State of play and essential tools      Equality, diversity and inclusion   The last theme is something I have been strongly working on for the last 2 years (if not my whole life). Although this theme runs through all workshops and talks, some of them were more strongly related to it (according to me). The workshops and talks I attended in this theme were:      Culturally sensitive learning analytics   The keynote talk of Roberto Maldonado-Martinez on ‘From Oysters to Pearls: Key Strategies for Communicating Learning Analytics Insights’   The keynote talk of Marco Kalz on ‘Unintended consequences of mainstreaming of technology-enhanced learning’   The keynote talk of Donald Clark on ‘AI changes everything – why AI will change online learning and its design’   The keynote talk of Carl Smith on ‘Context Engineering in TEL’   Although some talks and workshops spans multiple themes, I attached them to a main theme. As I publish new articles in this series I will update this page with the links. "

    "body": "2019/06/09 - Last week I attended the jTELSS2019, a summer school in the topic of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL). Now it is official, ready to attend #JTELSS19 Summer School in #Bari #Italy #phdlife cc @DSIatNUIG pic. twitter. com/lF9q53FFpQ &mdash; Bianca Pereira | Researcher (@bianca_oli_per) June 1, 2019Summer schools are excellent opportunities for PhD students to engage with the research community. In such events, we learn about the main topics under research in a given domain and meet the people working on these topics, we have opportunities to discuss our PhD work and, most importantly, we become part of the research community. In a few years time, when you start searching for collaborations (either within academia or as part of industry-academia partnerships), the PhD students that you see today in a summer school will be the people who you will be working with. Having participated in summer schools in the past and acknowledging their influence on my professional development, I always recommend PhD students in their 1st or 2nd year to attend one. So, being a PhD student myself (again) in the 1st year, it was already at the back of my mind to participate in a summer school. But, which one!? It was last year, when I attended the EC-TEL2018, that I heard the EATEL (European Association of Technology Enhanced Learning) was organising a summer school for this year. Since I really liked my experience in the EC-TEL2018, I decided to check what were the plans for their summer school. As the organisation of the jTELSS puts it:  The JTEL summer school provides a stimulating learning environment where participants get opportunities to: develop research skills, increase their knowledge base, collaborate with others in their own and complementary research areas, engage in debate, have access to experts in the field, and discuss their own work. I applied to participate, got selected, came to Bari in Italy for a week, and had an excellent experience. The event was very well organised, I met amazing people, came out with a good list of ideas and topics to explore, identified prospective collaboration opportunities, learned from other people’s experiences, and as a bonus ate tasty food and learned more about Italy’s history and landscape. Different from other summer schools I have seen, the program for the jTELSS2019 included a broad range of events: keynotes, thematic workshops, core methodology workshops, soft skills methodology workshops, career and innovation workshops, informal learning sessions, as well as social events. An additional interesting element, that I would not expect to see in a summer school but that I abolutely loved, was the connection with the European research landscape and with local research groups. The connection with the European landscape happened through the keynote talk by Riina Vuorikari , a member of the Digital Competences Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, on what is in the European Union agenda for Technology-Enhanced Learning. From her talk, I learned how research is important in the construction of evidence-based policy (in contrast to opinion-based ones) and how the research agenda, in particular research funding, is linked with the work from the European Commission.  Slides from Riina Vuorikari's presentation at jTELSS2019 Regarding connection with the local community, we visited FabLab Poliba, a maker space that serves as inter-disciplinary school, business, and community centre in the manufacturing area. The place was founded by the Politecnico di Bari based on the FabLab model created in MIT (Massachussets Institute of Technology). There we had a tour of the installations, where we had the opportunity to learn about the work of the local community in the use of 3D printing and wood cutting for art and architecture as well as the engagement of industry and the community in the development of digital skills.  FabLab Poliba In the next few days I will be posting a reflection on the other talks and workshops I participated. So, if you did not have the chance to attend the jTELSS2019, I will be sharing my learnings in this blog. On the other hand, if you did participate, I would love to learn what you got out of this experience. Have you ever attended a summer school? Or perhaps you plan to attend one?
